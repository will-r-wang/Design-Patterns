## Summary Notes

### Strategy Pattern
This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Adapter Pattern
This pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It allows classes to work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces

---

### Observer Pattern
This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically

### Decorator Pattern
This pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Iterator Pattern
This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### Simple Factory Pattern
This pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
